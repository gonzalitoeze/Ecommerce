**INTRO**
<h4>
UKE BJJ was born in Argentina. Our mission is build a new Jiu-jitsu clothing website to facilitate the purchase of imported and good quality products. The idea is to present a new design of kimonos and rashguards thanks to the recommendations of our competitors to obtain weaves and seams that are more resistant and lighter, allowing fighters to move more fluidly.
